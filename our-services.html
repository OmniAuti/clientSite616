          <p>What is Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)?</p>
          <p>
            “Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is a science that uses principles
            of learning and motivation that have come from decades of scientific
            research to solve problems of behavior that matter to society."
            (Tarbox & Tarbox, 2017)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a parent, friend, or relative of a child with special
            needs or a child who is normally developed but who has very
            challenging behavior, it is likely that you have asked yourself on
            repeating occasions: why does my child behave like that, and what
            can I do about it? I would also imagine that most of your answers
            are ascribed to circular reasoning: he does it because he is
            autistic, he has ADHD, or it is due to some other diagnosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            ABA does not deny the value of a diagnosis but rather finds the
            ‘why’ in another domain: The environment. In other words, we would
            not justify a tantrum with an immature or undeveloped brain and so
            wait or hope that he outgrows phase. Applied behavior analysis
            believes and works on the basis that every behavior has a purpose in
            one’s environment, and the behavior will only survive if that
            purpose is fulfilled.
          </p>
          <p>
            ABA scientific approach has been successfully used among different
            populations with a special impact within the ASD community. More
            than 1000 published studies support ABA as an evidence-based
            treatment for autism. (National Autism Center, 2015)

              LTW focuses on Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI)
              where learners start our services at an early age (2-6 years old).
              Research has shown that this treatment approach produces the
              largest gains when done consistently." (Tarbox & Tarbox, 2017)
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that every child with autism is able to learn- perhaps
              at different levels and speeds, based on individual
              characteristics, but important gains can be made when a
              combination of skills acquisition and reduction of challenging
              behaviors is included within a treatment plan. Our intervention
              primarily targets communication, social, and self-help skills to
              either boost the current client’s abilities or replace maladaptive
              behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
              LTW’s services are provided in our learner’s homes, schools, and
              communities. In this way, we involve his/her support system within
              our treatment which enhances the maintenance and generalization of
              the intervention results.
