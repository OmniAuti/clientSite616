                <p>My name is Ayna Camero Perez. After working as a lawyer providing support to the underserved and representing children and families in civil cases, I transitioned to the field of ABA. I started in this field in 2015 as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT). Working with families and children fueled a passion in me to teach. While working I completed coursework at the Florida Institute of Technology, a leader in ABA education, and I became certified as Board-Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst (BCaBA). As a BCaBA, I gained experience in evaluation, program development, and supervision, and at the same time I continued my own education by enrolling in a Master's degree program at the University of West Florida. In 2021 I earned my degree in Special Education with a concentration in Applied Behavior Analysis, and thereafter I successfully passed the board exam to become a BCBA (Board-Certified Behavior Analyst).</p>
                <p>Over these past few years I have worked in both clinic and home-based settings with children from 2 to 17 years old. My greatest passion is to teach verbal behavior. One of the biggest challenges that these children face is the inability to communicate- their needs, their feelings, and their understanding of the world and how it works. When parents hear a child's first words and soon see them develop communication skills, everybody's lives grow, and this kind of success is what fuels my passion to keep going. </p>
                <p>I would like to pay homage to Dr Jose Martinez Diaz, a leader in the field of ABA who has inspired me and many others in our service. His knowledge and passion have lighted my way, and now I hope to light the way for your child and your family.</p>
