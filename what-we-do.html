                <p>LTW is a personalized organization in which your child will receive one on one Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) services. To begin, I will complete a detailed family interview and analysis of your child’s individual behavior and abilities. With that information, I then will create, implement, and tailor a program that best fits your child’s specific needs. A Registered Behavior Technicians, (RBT), who is an individual educated and trained to implement the treatment program, is an integral part of the intensive therapy your child will receive. In addition to time I spend directly working with your child, I provide close supervision of and feedback to your RBT to ensure that the services are the most effective and highest quality that we can provide.</p>
